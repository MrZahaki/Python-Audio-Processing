Sudio is a Python audio processing library that provides developers and audio enthusiasts with a comprehensive toolkit for advanced sound manipulation. It offers intuitive, high-performance methods for time-domain audio editing, spectral filtering, dynamic effect application, and audio streaming, enabling complex audio transformations with minimal code complexity.


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install Sudio using pip:

```bash
pip install sudio --upgrade
```

### Basic Usage

Here's an example to get you started with sudio:

```python
import sudio

# Initialize Sudio Master
su = sudio.Master()

# Load an audio file
song = su.add('awesome_track.ogg')

# Slice, mix, and transform audio with ease
remix = song[10: 30]  + song[10.15: 25: .95, :'300'] * -10
remix.afx(sudio.process.fx.FadeEnvelope, preset=FadePreset.LINEAR_FADE_IN)

# Play and export the transformed audio
su.echo(remix)
su.export(remix, 'cool_remix.mp3')
```

 the original 20-second segment (10-30 seconds) is layered with a slightly time-shifted slice, filtered to low frequencies below 300 Hz, with .95 original speed, and dramatically attenuated by -10 dB to create a subtle, atmospheric undertone. The LINEAR_FADE_IN envelope effect adds a gradual volume increase, creating a smooth, building intensity to the remix. 

## üéπ Key Features
- Handles both real-time streaming and offline processing, allowing for dynamic applications like live audio effects as well as batch processing of audio files.
- Allows integration of custom processing modules.
- Flexible audio playback, precise time-domain slicing, and Comprehensive filtering options
- Advanced audio manipulation (joining, mixing, shifting)
- Real-time audio streaming with dynamic control (pause, resume, jump)
- Custom audio processing pipelines for complex effects
- Multi-format support with quality-controlled encoding/decoding
